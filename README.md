# Ant Find

**Ant Find** is a web-based application that uses the device's camera for object detection. This project utilizes TensorFlow.js and the COCO-SSD model to perform real-time **object detection**, with React and Vite serving as supporting technologies for building the web interface. The purpose of this project is to explore the feasibility, potential, and hardware requirements of browser-based end-to-end image recognition scenarios, paving the way for more complex applications.

## Features
- Real-time object detection using the browser's camera.
- Object detection powered by **COCO-SSD** and **TensorFlow.js**.
- Validate the feasibility of browser-based image recognition.

## Technology Stack
- **React**: Frontend framework used to build the user interface.
- **Vite**: Development environment for fast and efficient builds.
- **TensorFlow.js**: Machine learning library for real-time object detection.
- **JavaScript (JS)**: Primary programming language.

## Demo
A live demo of the project is deployed at: https://labs.antknt47.com/ant-find

## Installation and Setup
To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Antknt47/ant-find.git
   cd ant-find
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the app in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Usage
Once the app is running, you can:
- Use the camera to detect objects in real time.
- Explore the capabilities of TensorFlow.js for on-device machine learning in the browser.

## Future Plans
- Further develop the app to integrate more advanced models and features.
- Explore more complex use cases and hardware requirements for browser-based machine learning.
